I am an incoming Assistant Professor of [Human Systems Engineering](https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/hse/) in the [Polytechnic School](https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/), [Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering](https://engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Information from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) under the guidance of my incredible advisors, [Dr. Lionel P. Robert](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/lionelrobert/home) and [Dr. X. Jessie Yang](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/yang-xi-jessie/). My research focuses on how social contexts influence our interactions with cutting-edge technologies such as AI, robots, and automated vehicles. I aim to create a future where technology is not just smart but also empathetic. Specifically, my research interests include `Human-AI Collaboration and Learning`, `Human-Robot Interaction`, `Human Factors in Automated Vehicles`, and `User Experience (UX) Design`. I am actively looking for Ph.D. students and undergraduate/master researchers. See more information here.
