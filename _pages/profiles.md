I am actively seeking highly motivated students with strong backgrounds and interests in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly in areas such as transportation technology, healthcare robotics, AI, User Experience (UX) research and design, and data analytics.
### Prospective Ph.D. Students
I encourage strong and self-motivated candidates to apply, especially those with any of the following qualifications:
- Prior experience in studying human-computer interaction or human factors
- Knowledge and Skills in applied data science and programming
- An interdisciplinary research background (e.g., design, computer science, cognitive science)

If you are interested in joining my team, please apply to the [ASU Human Systems Engineering Ph.D. program](https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/hse/phd/) and select my name from the faculty member list during your application. Additionally, email me with the subject "Prospective PhD Student" and include:
- Your CV

### Undergraduate and Master's Students
I am also excited to work with undergraduate and master's students who are interested in my research areas. Opportunities are available for students with backgrounds or interests in human-computer interaction, intelligent transportation systems, applied data science, machine learning, or UX research/design. While funding is possible, it is not guaranteed. Typically, research assistantships are offered to students who have worked with me on a research project for at least one semester.<br />
