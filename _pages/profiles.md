I am actively seeking highly motivated students with strong backgrounds and interests in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly in areas such as transportation technology, healthcare robotics, AI, User Experience (UX) research and design, and data analytics.
### Prospective Ph.D. Students
I encourage strong and self-motivated candidates to apply, especially those with any of the following qualifications:
- Prior experience in studying human-computer interaction or human factors
- Knowledge and Skills in applied data science and programming
- An interdisciplinary research background (e.g., design, computer science, cognitive science)

If you are interested in joining my team, please apply to the Ph.D. program and select my name from the faculty member list during your application. Additionally, email me with the subject "Prospective PhD Student" and include:
- Your CV
- A brief description of your background and research interests
- Representative publications or writing samples (if available)
- The names and contact information of at least two references for your application (if available)

### Undergraduate and Master's Students
I am also excited to work with undergraduate and master's students who are interested in my research areas. Opportunities are available for students with backgrounds or interests in human-computer interaction, intelligent transportation systems, applied data science, machine learning, or UX research/design. While funding is possible, it is not guaranteed. Typically, research assistantships are offered to students who have worked with me on a research project for at least one semester.<br />
If you wish to work with me, please email me with the subject "Prospective Undergraduate/Master's Student" and include:
