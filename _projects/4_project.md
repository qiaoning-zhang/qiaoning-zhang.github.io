This research explores the factors influencing user expectations and trust in Automated Vehicles (AVs), both of which are pivotal to the acceptance and adoption of these transformative technologies. AVs have the potential to revolutionize transportation by enhancing safety, efficiency, and convenience, generating widespread interest. However, persistent apprehensions around AV safety, performance, and reliability create barriers to their widespread acceptance and utilization. This suggests a discrepancy between the theoretical advantages of AVs and public perceptions. To address this discrepancy and accelerate AV adoption, this research undertakes a comprehensive investigation into the factors shaping public perceptions, with a specific focus on the formation of expectations and trust. This study revolves around two core research questions: 

- What individual factors shape people’s expectations of AVs?
- How do these expectations impact their trust in AVs?

An online survey was used to collect data including expectation, perceived performance, and trust in AVs from 443 participants which represent U.S. driver population.  Participants were presented with: 1) sunny weather and normal driving behavior; 2) sunny weather and aggressive driving behavior; 3) snowy weather and normal driving behavior; 4) snowy weather and aggressive driving behavior.

Using the polynomial regression and response surface methodology, results from this research highlight two major findings. First, individual characteristics, including demographic factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity, along with personality traits (e.g., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness), significantly shape people's preconceived expectations of AVs. Second, expectations significantly influence the level of trust in AVs, affected by the disconfirmation effect.

This research embarks on a profound exploration of expectations and trust, offering critical insights that will shape the future development and implementation of AVs. It explores the complex dynamics of expectation and trust formation, essential for user acceptance and adoption of AVs. By illuminating these components, this research helps navigate the complexities and potentials of AVs, paving the way for an imminent paradigm shift in transportation.
