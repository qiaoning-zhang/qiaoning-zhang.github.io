This research explores the factors influencing user expectations and trust in Automated Vehicles (AVs), both of which are pivotal to the acceptance and adoption of these transformative technologies. AVs have the potential to revolutionize transportation by enhancing safety, efficiency, and convenience, generating widespread interest. However, persistent apprehensions around AV safety, performance, and reliability create barriers to their widespread acceptance and utilization. This suggests a discrepancy between the theoretical advantages of AVs and public perceptions. To address this discrepancy and accelerate AV adoption, this research undertakes a comprehensive investigation into the factors shaping public perceptions, with a specific focus on the formation of expectations and trust. This study revolves around two core research questions: 

- What individual factors shapepeopleâ€™s expectations of AVs?
- How do these expectations impact their trust in AVs?

Results from this research highlight two major findings. First, individual characteristics, including demographic factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity, along with personality traits (e.g., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness), significantly shape people's preconceived expectations of AVs. Second, expectations significantly influence the level of trust in AVs, affected by the disconfirmation effect.

This research embarks on a profound exploration of expectations and trust, offering critical insights that will shape the future development and implementation of AVs. It explores the complex dynamics of expectation and trust formation, essential for user acceptance and adoption of AVs. By illuminating these components, this research helps navigate the complexities and potentials of AVs, paving the way for an imminent paradigm shift in transportation.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
