Automated decision aids are used in various fields, such as military operations and medical diagnosis. To ensure appropriate trust and reliance on these systems, our study focuses on the following research question:
- How do different types of likelihood information impact human operatorsâ€™ trust in automation and their team performance?

To investigate this, we designed and conducted an experiment in the context of a simulated surveillance task. The results indicate that not all likelihood information equally aids human-automation team performance. Specifically, automated decision aids should avoid directly presenting the hit and correct rejection rates. These findings can be applied to the design of automated decision aids to improve human-automation team performance.
