Automated decision aids have been used in various domains, such as military operations and medical diagnosis. To facilitate appropriate trust in and dependence on automation, this study focuses on the following research question: 

- How do different types of likelihood information impact human operatorsâ€™ trust in automation and their team performance?

To examine this research question, we designed and conducted an experiment in the context of a simulated surveillance task. The results indicate that not all likelihood information is equal in aiding human-automation team performance. Specifically, automated decision aids should avoid directly presenting the hit and correct rejection rates. These findings can be applied to the design of automated decision aids to improve human-automation team performance.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
